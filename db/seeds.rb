# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.destroy_all
# Product.destroy_all

# customer = User.create(email: "customer@test.com", password: "123456")

# product = Product.create!(name: "8x4", category: "Grue", numberplate: "867 RJB 34", price: 870, description: "Tr√®s beau camion", availability: true)
